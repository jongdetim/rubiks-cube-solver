## General use
Program takes a mix as parameter

```
./rubik "F R U B L D"
```
The letter means turning a single turn, (90°), clockwise, the corresponding face.

**F (front)**:
the face facing the solver.

**B (back)**:
the back face.

**R (right)**:
the right face.

**L (left)**:
the left face.

**U (up)**:
the upper face.

**D (down)**:
the face opposite to the upper face.
Middle layer turns as well as cube rotations are not accepted

### Parameters
A mix is a sequence of moves to apply to a cube from a solved position
The notation for the moves used is the [international notation](http://www.rubiksplace.com/move-notations/)

### Modifiers
			```
			' (e.g. D')
	```
	Indicates turning the corresponding face a single turn, (90°), counter-clockwise. (known as "prime")
	```
	2 (e.g. R2)
	```
	Indicates turning the corresponding face 2 single turns (180°). The direction of the turning does not matter here.

Valid sequence example:
	```
	./rubik "R2 D' B' D F2 R F2 R2 U L' F2 U'"
	```

### Return
	The program will return on the standard output the move sequence to be applied to solve the mixed cube
